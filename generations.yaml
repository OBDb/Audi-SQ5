    description: "The original Audi SQ5 was notable for being Audi's first S-badged diesel model in many markets. The SQ5 TDI featured a 2967cc V6 twin-turbocharged TDI diesel engine producing 313 PS at 3,900-4,500 rpm with 650 Nm of torque at 1,450-2,800 rpm, paired with an 8-speed Tiptronic transmission. North American markets received a different version with a 2995cc supercharged 3.0L V6 TFSI petrol engine producing 354 HP at 5,500-6,500 rpm with 470 Nm of torque at 4,000-4,500 rpm. Both versions featured Audi's quattro all-wheel drive system with torque vectoring, sport suspension lowered by 30mm, distinctive styling with aluminum-look exterior mirrors, quad exhaust tips, and unique 20-inch wheels. The SQ5 went on sale in the first quarter of 2013 and combined impressive performance with the practicality of an SUV."

    description: "Built on the MLB Evo platform, the second-generation SQ5 debuted in September 2016 for the 2017 model year. In North American markets, it features a 2995cc V6 twin-scroll turbocharged engine (EA839) producing 354 HP with 369 lb-ft (500 Nm) of torque from 1,370 rpm, paired with an 8-speed ZF automatic transmission. The SQ5 maintains the full-time rear-biased quattro AWD system with Torsen CSM self-locking center differential (40% front/60% rear distribution). European markets retained diesel options with the 3.0L V6 TDI engine. The design features aggressive styling with distinctive S design elements, an available sport differential for enhanced handling, and updated technology including digital instrument cluster and MMI infotainment. A 2021 facelift updated the styling with revised grille, bumper side air intakes, side sill, and rear trim. In January 2021, Audi introduced a Sportback variant. Production ended in February 2025."
