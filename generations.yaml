    description: "The original Audi SQ5 was notable for being Audi's first S-badged diesel model in many markets, featuring a 3.0L V6 TDI bi-turbo diesel engine producing 313 HP and massive 650 Nm of torque. North American markets received a different version with a supercharged 3.0L V6 petrol engine producing 354 HP. Both versions were paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and quattro all-wheel drive. The SQ5 featured lowered sport suspension, distinctive styling with aluminum-look exterior mirrors, quad exhaust tips, and unique 20-inch wheels. It combined impressive performance with the practicality of an SUV and relatively good fuel efficiency, especially in the diesel variant."
